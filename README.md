# Natural Language Processing
## Machine Learning with Python: NLP

### Description
In this campaign, we build on your machine learning knowledge and zoom into natural language processing (NLP). NLP focuses on developing computer algorithms and models that can understand, interpret and generate natural language. 

NLP has become increasingly important in recent years due to the rapid growth of digital content, including text, speech and video data. With the help of NLP, computers can process and analyse large amounts of text data. 

Note that this campaign assumes you have some background in Python, EDA and basic machine learning. We will also be making use of Jupyter notebook. If these are completely new to you, please go through the following on StackUp Learn first before starting this campaign:
  - Introduction to Python
  - Machine Learning in Python: Regression

1. NLP Basics for Text Processing
2. Vectorization
3. Practicing NLP Techniques: Fake News Classifier
