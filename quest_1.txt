As I walked down the street, the sound of honking cars and chatter filled my ears. The sun beat down on my skin, making me feel hot and sticky. I decided to stop at the nearby cafe to grad an iced coffee. The air conditioning inside was a welcome relief from the heat outside. T took a sip of the refreshing drink and felt the coolness spread throughout my body. Sitting down at a table, I watched as peope hurried by outside, going about their day.
